 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.781   TIME= 19:33:05
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.812   TIME= 19:33:05
 Material number 19 (used by element 4776 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.938   TIME= 19:33:05
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.5 is defined in the model.  Switch to    
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.953   TIME= 19:33:06
 Coefficient ratio exceeds 1.0e8 - Check results.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      23.438   TIME= 19:33:29
 Table _FIX is an ANSYS reserved table name.  It is used to constrain    
 structural degrees of freedom to their current displaced status.  This  
 table should not be used for other purposes.                            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      23.469   TIME= 19:33:29
 Material number 19 (used by element 4776 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      47.391   TIME= 19:33:53
 Material number 19 (used by element 4776 ) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.
